## Graph Representations

### Adjacency Matrix

An **n × n** matrix where `matrix[i][j]` indicates the presence of an edge between vertices `i` and `j`.

### Adjacency List

A list of lists where `list[i]` contains all adjacent vertices to vertex `i`.

## Algorithms

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- Used for level-order traversal.
- Time Complexity: O(V + E).

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Used for path-finding and connected components.
- Time Complexity: O(V + E).

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) using a priority queue.
